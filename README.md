# Auto-porting-tool-for-Open-source-Z-OS
Developed a Python-based automation tool that streamlines the process of porting open-source software to IBM z/OS. It follows a structured workflow for detecting errors, managing patches while also creating datasets that map issues error to fix. I integrated a python code to generate synthetic data which reduced manual debugging &amp; patching efforts.
